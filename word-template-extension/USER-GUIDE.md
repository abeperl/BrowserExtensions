## üìù Understanding Templates

### What Are Templates?

Templates are Word documents with special placeholders that get replaced with real data. Think of them as forms that fill themselves out automatically.

**Example Template:**
```
BUSINESS PROPOSAL

Client: {{COMPANY}}
Contact: {{CONTACT_NAME}}
Email: {{EMAIL}}
Phone: {{PHONE}}

Project: {{PROJECT_NAME}}
Estimated Cost: {{AMOUNT}}
Start Date: {{START_DATE}}
Completion: {{END_DATE}}

Description:
{{DESCRIPTION}}
```

### Placeholder Rules

- **Format**: Always use double curly braces `{{FIELD_NAME}}`
- **Naming**: Use UPPERCASE with underscores (e.g., `{{FIRST_NAME}}`)
- **Spacing**: No spaces inside braces: `{{NAME}}` not `{{ NAME }}`
- **Case Sensitive**: `{{EMAIL}}` is different from `{{email}}`

### Common Placeholders

| Placeholder | What It Captures | Example |
|-------------|------------------|---------|
| `{{TITLE}}` | Page titles, headings | "About Our Company" |
| `{{COMPANY}}` | Company names | "Acme Corporation" |
| `{{DATE}}` | Dates in various formats | "January 15, 2024" |
| `{{AMOUNT}}` | Prices, costs, numbers | "$1,234.56" |
| `{{EMAIL}}` | Email addresses | "contact@company.com" |
| `{{PHONE}}` | Phone numbers | "(555) 123-4567" |
| `{{ADDRESS}}` | Street addresses | "123 Main St, City, State" |
| `{{DESCRIPTION}}` | Longer text content | Product descriptions, etc. |

## üèóÔ∏è Creating Professional Templates

### Template Design Best Practices

1. **Start with Layout**
   - Design your document structure first
   - Add headers, footers, and formatting
   - Use tables for organized data

2. **Add Placeholders Strategically**
   - Place them where variable content belongs
   - Keep placeholder names descriptive
   - Group related placeholders together

3. **Format Placeholders**
   - Apply formatting (bold, italic, font size) to placeholders
   - The formatting will be preserved when replaced
   - Use styles for consistent appearance

## üåê Website Data Extraction

### How the Extension Finds Data

The extension automatically scans web pages for common data patterns:

- **Text in headings** (H1, H2, H3 tags)
- **Contact information** (emails, phones, addresses)
- **Monetary amounts** (prices, costs, totals)
- **Dates** (various formats and contexts)
- **Company names** (from titles, headers, contact sections)
- **Form data** (visible form fields and labels)

### Optimizing Data Extraction

#### Best Websites for Extraction
- **Company websites**: Contact pages, about pages, service pages
- **E-commerce sites**: Product pages, pricing pages
- **Business directories**: Listings with contact information
- **News articles**: Headlines, dates, content
- **Social media profiles**: Business information

#### Tips for Better Results
1. **Visit specific pages**: Go to contact pages for contact info, pricing pages for amounts
2. **Look for structured data**: Tables, lists, and forms work best
3. **Check page completeness**: Ensure all needed data is visible on the page
4. **Use clean pages**: Avoid pages with excessive ads or clutter

### Manual Data Selection

If automatic extraction doesn't capture what you need:

1. **Highlight text** on the webpage before clicking the extension
2. **Use the custom field option** in the extension popup
3. **Map specific page elements** to template placeholders
