# Privacy Policy - Word Template Extension

**Last Updated**: August 5, 2024

## Overview

Word Template Extension ("we", "our", or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how our browser extension handles data and what information, if any, is collected, used, or shared.

## Data Collection and Processing

### What We Collect

**We do not collect any personal data.** Word Template Extension operates entirely locally on your computer and does not transmit any user data to external servers or cloud services.

### How Data is Processed

1. **Local Processing Only**: All data extraction, template processing, and document generation occurs locally on your computer using native messaging to communicate with locally installed software.

2. **No Data Transmission**: The extension does not send any extracted data, document content, or usage information to external servers, analytics services, or third-party providers.

3. **Temporary Data**: Any data extracted from web pages is temporarily stored in your browser's local storage and is automatically cleared when you close the extension or navigate away from the page.

## Permissions Explained

Our extension requires the following browser permissions:

- **activeTab**: To extract data from the currently active web page when you explicitly click the extension icon
- **storage**: To save your extension settings (templates, preferences) locally in your browser
- **nativeMessaging**: To communicate with the locally installed Word processing component
- **contextMenus**: To provide right-click context menu options for quick access
- **notifications**: To display status notifications about document generation progress
- **scripting**: To inject content scripts for data extraction functionality

## Data Storage

- **Local Browser Storage**: Extension settings and preferences are stored locally in your browser using Chrome/Edge's storage API
- **No Cloud Storage**: We do not use any cloud storage services or external databases
- **Template Files**: Your Word templates are stored locally on your computer in directories you specify

## Third-Party Services

Word Template Extension does not integrate with or send data to any third-party services, analytics platforms, or external APIs.

## Data Security

Since all processing occurs locally:

- Your data never leaves your computer
- No network transmission of sensitive information
- No server-side vulnerabilities or data breaches possible
- Complete control over your data remains with you

## User Control

You have complete control over:

- What data is extracted (you must explicitly click "Extract")
- Which templates are used
- Where generated documents are saved
- All extension settings and preferences
- Ability to uninstall the extension at any time, which removes all local data

## Native Messaging

The extension communicates with a locally installed native messaging host (Python application) to process Word documents. This communication:

- Occurs only on your local computer
- Does not involve any network activity
- Uses standard browser native messaging protocols
- Can be monitored through browser developer tools if desired

## Children's Privacy

Our extension does not specifically target children under 13. However, since we collect no personal information, there are no specific privacy concerns related to children's data.

## Changes to Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in the extension's documentation and store listings. Continued use of the extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## Data Retention

Since we collect no personal data:

- No personal data is retained
- Local settings persist until you uninstall the extension
- Extracted data is temporary and automatically cleared
- Generated documents are saved only where you choose to save them

## User Rights
